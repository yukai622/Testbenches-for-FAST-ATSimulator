# Testbenches-for-FAST-ATSimulator

After you derive the thermal model, The SystemC-AMS thermal simulator is connected to a testbench module having an interface complementary to the that of the thermal network: power ports are in output, and temperature ports are in input. The testbench generates stimuli over time for the thermal simulator. 

Stimuli generation through the construction of a dedicated testbench, implemented either as (a) a trace of power consumption values, or (b) by simulating the thermal model concurrently with functional and power execution.

As shown in the belwo flow chart, the two kinds of stimuli list in the bottom box.

The first option is to load power consumption traces from files previously generated by a power simulator, and to dump the estimated
temperature values to a thermal trace file for future elaborations. 

In block-level mode, a power trace per component is needed, and the relative power values can be either measured or estimated by a power simulator.

The second option for the generation of input stimuli consists of simulating the RC network using power values dynamically generated with functional simulation. In this scenario, the testbench wraps SystemC processes implementing the power models, or functional models enriched with power information.

This repository help you to build the testbenches automatically for option (a). While these testbenches are different for steady state simulation or transient state simulation. 

##### Steady state vs. Transient state thermal simlation
Steady state analysis determines the temperature distribution based on a power density distribution that does not change over time, by assuming either typical power values (i.e., average power) or worst case scenarios (i.e., maximum power consumption). This kind of analysis is thus useful to make preliminary design exploration, e.g., to guide floorplanning or to make quick leakage estimations. On the contrary, transient analysis focuses on the temporal response to time varying conditions, that is especially crucial to evaluate reliability effects. Accumulated heat can indeed determine peak temperatures much higher than the average values. Additionally, thermal stress strictly depends on thermal cycling and on the length of the peak temperature periods. As a result, transient simulation allows to gather a more complete estimation of the evolving circuit conditions, and allows to consider temperature as an additional design dimension.
